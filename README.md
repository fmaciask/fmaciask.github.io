Thanks for visiting this page.
I'm a newb DevOp that it's in the middle of something big. I'm studying all possibilities that fits the following requirement:

- Open source

- Linux base

- Scalable

- High Availability

- CI and CD compliant


Most of the actual repositories are forks from interesting projects. 

### Important

I usually write bash scripting, and most of them are "small" scripts that maybe aren't clear what they do, but I can assure that in their context, they work fine.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with some files? Send me a message and I'll try to help.
